- **Date Completed**: Sep 29, 2025
- **Time Spent**: 10 minutes
- **Connection**: `ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`

## Level Goal

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level toÂ **port 30000 on localhost**.

## Analysis
- I already have the password for this level which I found by following the path specified on the previous level.
- I need to submit the password on port 30000 on localhost.

## Solution
1. Used `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` to view password file and copy it.
2. Used Netcat to connect to localhost 30000 and entered the current level password.

### Commands Used:
```bash
# Step 1: [View password file contents]
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

# Step 2: [Connected to localhost 30000 and entered password]  
nc localhost 30000
